# TwitterCrawler
Twitter crawler that I created for a research project using a free dev environment and the tweepy API. A major limitation of the free version is that you can only receive tweets up to 7 days prior, and only 100 tweets at a time. To get past the limitation, Twitter requires you to purchase a subscription to Twitter Premium or Enterprise.
